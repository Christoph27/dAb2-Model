### In vitro / physico-chemical Data <a id="invitro-and-physico-chemical-data"></a>

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of dAb2. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below. 

| **Parameter** | **Unit** | **Value** | Source                    | **Description**                                              |
| :------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MW            | g/mol    | 25600     | [Sepp2015](#5-references) | Molecular weight                                             |
| r             | nm       | 2.43      | calculated   from MW      | Hydrodynamic solute radius. Calculated by empirical equation given in [Niederalt2018](#5-references), supplemental material |
| Kd (FcRn)     | µM       | 999,999   |                           | high value representing no FcRn binding                      |

### PK Data <a id="PK-data"></a>

Published plasma and tissue PK data on dAb2 in mice were used.

| Publication               | Description                                                  |

| [Sepp2015](#5-references) | Plasma and tissue PK data after an intravenous dose of dose of 10 mg/kg in mice. Tissue concentrations were analyzed using quantitative whole-body autoradiography. The concentrations were reported as percentage of injected dose / g tissue. These values were converted to concentrations in µg/ml assuming a density of 1 g/ml for all tissues except for bone for which a density of 1.5 g/ml was assumed (as in Ref. [Baxter 1994](#5-references)). Furthermore, a body weight of 29 g (i.e. a dose of  290 µg) was assumed for unit conversion of the experimental concentrations (body weight range reported: 26-33 g). |
