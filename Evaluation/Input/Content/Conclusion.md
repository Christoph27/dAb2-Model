The herein presented PBPK model overall adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of a domain antibody dAb2  in mice - except for kidney concentrations. Total kidney concentrations cannot be described by the standard kidney representation of PK-Sim for renally excreted biologics, since drug within the tubular fluid is not represented in the organ concentration. Apart from kidney, the largest deviations between measured and simulated concentration-time profiles are observed for spleen for which the initial concentrations are overestimated by the model and bone for which the initial concentrations are underestimated. 



The PK data of dAb2 (except kidney concentrations) had been used during the development of the generic large molecule PBPK model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)) together with PK data from 5 other compounds (7E3, BAY 79-4620, CDA1, MEDI-524 & MEDI-524-YTE).
